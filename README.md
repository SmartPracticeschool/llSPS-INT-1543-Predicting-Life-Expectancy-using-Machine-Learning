**Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning-**

The given problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country also we have provided with various features like Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth, GDP, Education, Alcohol intake etc. From this given feature and problem statement we come to the conclusion that this is Regression problem in which based on historical data we have to predict life expectancy (life span) of individual.<>
